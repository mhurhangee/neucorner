A fresh start.

A new chapter.

Turning the page.

Repeat cliches ad nauseam.

But even so, starting anew does feel good.

I built a personal website before, but I never liked it.

I built one I thought the world wanted to see, but not one I liked.

For reference, see [here](https://aiconsult.uk).

I hated the domain from the moment I bought it.

I enjoyed the colour scheme's subtle nod to my heritage.

I included "fancy" animations, but now I just think they are a waste of carbon.

It never really felt right, like me or mine.

I knew something was wrong as I felt ashamed of it.

So here we are ... starting again ...

This time, I am building something I want rather than something I think the world wants to see.
