Often, I feel agentic AI is too much of a black box. Most platforms hide their “secret sauce,” but transparency is an overlooked part of AI. Showing users exactly what the AI is basing decisions on matters.

One easy step is just letting users see the raw JSON behind the scenes—nicely formatted and readable. It’s a bit technical, but it’s a start. If a user sees the AI has called the wrong tool or missed a document, they know to just try again.

To do this, I needed a clean, [visually pleasing JSON component](/json-viewer) to drop into my projects.

If you’ve used something like [react-json-view](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-json-view), you know it works, but it’s bulky and doesn’t fit well with modern UI.

I built a lightweight JSON viewer that plays nicely with Shadcn UI and drops straight into any React app.

### Aims

- Toggle between a collapsible tree and raw JSON.
- Copy the path to any node, or the whole output.
- Handles invalid JSON.
- No bloat and customisable.

### Example

Simply pass the JSON data you want to view.

```tsx
<JsonViewer data={apiResponse} defaultView="tree" showCopyPath maxHeight="400px" />
```

Copy out the JSON path you need in one click.

```json
data.users[0].profile.preferences.languages[1]
```

It’s a handy way to inspect API or AI responses while developing or displaying them in a user-friendly way.
