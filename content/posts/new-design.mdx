When building websites, I’ve always relied on the excellent [shadcn ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) library—a fantastic foundation for any React project.

For this site, I wanted to push the design further. I drew inspiration from the [neobrutalism](https://www.neobrutalism.dev) library, but found the bold drop shadows had more impact when used selectively.

Instead, I leaned into the elegant, focused typography of the [Swiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_design) design movement, stripping away extra styling and letting the text take centre stage.

This time, I aimed for clarity and confidence in the type. Ultimately, what I want to communicate is text, so why not let it stand on its own two feet?

I have always been a fan of retro aesthetics. [Hiroshi Nagai’s](https://www.ecosia.org/images?q=Hiroshi%20Nagai) artwork has been my go-to for wallpapers.

I’ve tried to bring some subtle, early web simplicity into the design to keep things clean and uncluttered.

I’m happy with how it’s turned out so far. It’s still a work in progress—soon I’ll bring in some of my experiments and new components, and I’m curious to see how the design evolves with added complexity.

As an example, when writing this post I added ↗ as an external link indicator.
