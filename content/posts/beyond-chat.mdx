Since the ChatGPT big-bang in 2023, chat interfaces have dominated AI. 

*A blinking cursor, a text box, animated dots, a chat bubble, text spewed out faster than you can read*.  

Wash. Rinse. Repeat. Ad nauseam.


## Why chat?

**Familiarity.** Everyone knows how to use chat. No learning curve, no friction.

**Tech momentum.** ChatGPT set the standard. LLMs are trained on chat data—chat is the default.

**One-size-fits-all.** Throw a chat UI at any problem. “Prompting” shifts the heavy lifting onto the user.

**Laziness.** Minimal design, minimal dev effort. Quick to ship. Easy “AI” checkbox for any CEO or product manager.

But the cracks are showing.

## Why move beyond chat?  
The boom in “copilots for X” was logical at first. Now?

Most SMEs are likely better off with a generalist like ChatGPT, Copilot or Claude.  A  system prompt can implement the "copilot for X". I don't see this trend abating. Competing with OpenAI, Google, Meta and Microsoft is hard.

User independence, once a feature, is now a bottleneck—especially for anything innovative or differentiated.

A chat UI puts all the responsibility (and blame) on the user. 

Didn’t get what you wanted? Probably your fault. Try again. Didn’t phrase the prompt right? Try again. Not sure what went wrong? Try again. It’s a cycle that makes users feel like they’re the problem.

A chat UI is a black box. You send a message, you get an answer. You have no idea how it got that answer, or why it said what it said. Was it confident because it’s right, or just because it always sounds confident? Was the answer fact or fiction? Up-to-date or out-of-date? You can’t tell. Most users can’t—and shouldn’t have to.

Worst of all: chat UIs feed the myth that AI is magic. If you ask, it will answer—no matter what. It rarely pushes back. It rarely says “I don’t know.” If you lead it, it follows. Sycophantic and submissive. This creates a dangerous illusion of competence—AI as an all-knowing oracle. In reality, it’s often hallucinating.

That’s not a user experience. That’s a guessing game wrapped in a chat bubble.

## The future?  
Most users now expect AI = chat. But the future of AI UI is not just another text box. It’s about intelligent, adaptive interfaces woven into real workflows—more intuitive, less opaque, and less work for the user.

So, what’s beyond chat? That’s next.
